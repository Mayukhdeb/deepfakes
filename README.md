I will arrange all of the notes properly once I get a better idea of how it works.

## Notes from the main paper 

### The original method

This required three main parts:
1. An encoder that encodes an image into a lower dimensional vector.
2. A decoder that reproduces face A from the encoded vector
3. Another decoder that reproduces face B from the encoded vector. 

This image from the original paper summarises it better than anything else:
